# Vodify

Scripts for downloading Twitch VODs in their entirety.


## Installation for Windows

- Download the repository
- Run for_windows.bat as administrator.
This will install the streamlink dependency, used by the main vodify.py script for downloading the VODs. It also updates pip and runs vodify.py when finished.

## Installation for Linux

- Download the repository
- Set the shell script to executable
- Run the script
```javascript
chmod +x for_linux.sh
./for_linux.sh
```
## Usage
Windows users: Run for_windows.bat
- Enter the VOD url
- Enter the quality you'd like to download
- Enter the filename for the VOD

Linux users: Run for_linux.sh
- Enter the VOD url
- Enter the quality you'd like to download
- Enter the filename for the VOD 


You can create a desktop shortcut for the bash script instead of launching it from the cloned repository each time.
